How to run simulations.

0) In order to run the simulations, Unity is needed: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download.
After Unity Hub has finished, a Unity Version is needed to be installed (under Installs). For this project, version 2020.3.21f1 was used. This install will take some time so be patient. If this is not installed before trying to open the project, it will prompt with a message saying that you need to install the specific version. 

1) Clone the project from github: https://github.com/Eijs666/BLE-Simulation.git 
Depending on which simulation you want you should use the following commands: 
git clone --branch default https://github.com/Eijs666/BLE-Simulation.git (default simulation, rejsekort vs BLE).
git clone --branch signal_strength https://github.com/Eijs666/BLE-Simulation.git (simulation of signal strength)
git clone --branch stressTest https://github.com/Eijs666/BLE-Simulation.git (simulation of stress test and failure of beacon)
git clone --branch unintended https://github.com/Eijs666/BLE-Simulation.git (simulation of how to handle unintended check-in)

2) Open Unity Hub and add a project. Navigate to where the project is saved and add it. 

3) The project can be run by pressing the "run" button. In order to watch the other simulations, you will need to delete the project and repeat step 1.
